# Reinforcement Learning Implementations

This is an old repo of RL implementations I wrote when I was first entering the field. Much of this code is not very good and needs refactored.

## Create Conda env and install dependencies
`conda create -n rl_implementations python=3.8.8`
`conda activate rl_implementations`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run Tabular Q-Learning in GridWorld

Running Tabular Q-Learning in a gridworld with visualization:
`python Tabular_Q_Grid_World/gridWorld.py`

<!-- ## Other RL algorithms

Install tensorflow
